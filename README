Web::Passwd - Web-based htpasswd Management

Web::Passwd is a web-based utility for managing Apache htpasswd files.
It uses the CGI::Application framework, so functionality is encapsulated
in the module and very little code is required to create an instance.

This was written expressly for Apache webserver 1.3 or higher running
under Linux.  However, there is nothing as far as I am aware that would
prevent execution on Apache 2.x or Apache under Windows.
